## Diary

9.9.2024

I practised with Andrew Steward's " How you start writing LiveView " video where he makes Link app allmost from scratch. I did the Links.
Then I added user_id' and username etc fields to my Blog and I have to figure out how to get them to work. Gladdly I have gray hairs already. But I did it and got changres to work in generated code. So happy. So happy. I did not quit. I can move on.

And I'm so bored with instruction videos... I need so much to go back and "read" again sometimes many times again.

Well. Test do not pass. Credo and Dialyzer passes so very good. I have to figure out how to split them to see some green :D
