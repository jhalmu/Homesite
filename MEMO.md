- Put newest memo first.
- Adding time to blog posts is clunky. Time is not set automatically. What can we do?
- Function to show that field is empty is too aggressive.
- We need simple dashboard style landing page when user logs in. No statistics yet.

### Session: User Profile Features Implementation

#### Completed
- ✅ Answered Playwright tests question (documented findings in MEMO)
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Added 6 profile fields to users table (display_name, avatar, bio, website_url, bluesky_handle, mastodon_handle)
- ✅ **User Schema**: Updated with new fields and profile_changeset with URL validation
- ✅ **AvatarGenerator Module**: Created SVG avatar generator with user initials and DaisyUI theme colors
- ✅ **Accounts Context**: Added profile management functions (change_user_profile, update_user_profile, get_avatar_url, delete_avatar_file)
- ✅ **UI Components**: Created `<.avatar>` and `<.author_byline>` components using MODERN_CSS_GUIDE.md patterns (clamp, fluid sizing)
- ✅ **Settings Page**: Extended with profile form and avatar file upload (LiveView native uploads)
- ✅ **Post Views**: Updated PostLive.Show with author byline display
- ✅ **Uploads Directory**: Created priv/static/uploads/avatars/ with .gitignore rules
- ✅ **Tests**: Fixed 2 test failures, all 142 tests passing
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Fixed Credo refactoring issue (Enum.map_join), 0 failures

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Avatar System:**
- File uploads handled with Phoenix LiveView native `allow_upload/3`
- Accepts JPG/PNG, max 5MB
- Generates unique filenames: `{user_id}_{timestamp}.{ext}`
- Auto-deletes old avatar when new one uploaded
- Falls back to SVG avatar with initials if no upload

**SVG Avatar Generation:**
- Deterministic colors based on user ID (8 DaisyUI-inspired color combinations)
- Displays up to 2 initials from display_name or first letter of email
- Returns data URL for direct use in img src

**Modern CSS Patterns Applied:**
- Fluid sizing: `w-[clamp(2rem,8vw,3rem)]`
- Fluid spacing: `gap-[clamp(0.5rem,2vw,1rem)]`
- Fluid typography: `text-[clamp(0.875rem,2vw,1rem)]`
- Responsive layouts following MODERN_CSS_GUIDE.md

**Profile Fields Added:**
1. `display_name` - Public name (max 100 chars)
2. `avatar` - File path to uploaded image
3. `bio` - User biography (max 500 chars)
4. `website_url` - Personal website (URL validation)
5. `bluesky_handle` - Bluesky social (max 255 chars)
6. `mastodon_handle` - Mastodon social (max 255 chars)

#### Current Status
- **Tests:** 142 tests, 0 failures ✅
- **Credo:** 5 design suggestions (optional nested module aliasing, pre-existing)
- **Profile system fully functional** - Users can edit profile, upload avatars, view author info on posts
- **Auto-generated avatars** working for users without uploads

#### Next Steps / TODO
- Update navigation header with user avatar
- Create public profile page (UserLive.Profile) at `/users/:id`
- Add tests for new profile functionality
- Consider remaining MEMO questions:
  - Time input for blog posts (clunky)
  - Empty field validation (too aggressive)
  - Dashboard landing page

### Session: Documentation Review and Outstanding Questions

#### Playwright Tests Investigation

**Question Answered:** What was playwright tests command?

**Findings:**
- **Command:** `mix test --include playwright`
- **Status:** Playwright is configured but NOT actively used
  - Dependencies installed: `phoenix_test_playwright` 0.9.1
  - Configuration exists in `config/test.exs`
  - Tests excluded by default in `test/test_helper.exs`
  - **No actual Playwright tests exist** in the codebase
  - Playwright browser binaries NOT installed (requires npm setup)

**Configuration Details:**
```elixir
# config/test.exs
config :phoenix_test,
  playwright: [
    browser: :chromium,
    browser_launch_timeout: 10_000,
    trace: System.get_env("PLAYWRIGHT_TRACE", "false") in ~w(t true),
    trace_dir: "tmp"
  ]

# test/test_helper.exs
ExUnit.configure(exclude: [playwright: true])
```

**To Actually Use Playwright (if needed in future):**
1. Install Playwright via npm:
   ```bash
   npm --prefix assets i -D playwright
   npm --prefix assets exec -- playwright install chromium --with-deps
   ```
2. Create test case using `PhoenixTest.Playwright.Case`
3. Write tests tagged with `@tag :playwright`
4. Run with `mix test --include playwright`

**Conclusion:** Playwright is ready to use but currently dormant. Standard `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` is sufficient for current needs.

### Session: CLAUDE.md Creation and Project Documentation

#### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with:
  - Information source priority (AGENTS.md → Context7 → Internet)
  - Essential commands for development, database, assets, and documentation
  - Architecture overview including Scope-based pattern
  - Technology stack (Phoenix 1.8.1, LiveView, Ecto, Tailwind v4, DaisyUI)
  - Data models and relationships (User, Post, Tag, PostTag)
  - Router organization and LiveView structure
  - Important guidelines for authentication, Phoenix 1.8, forms, testing
  - Git & GitHub workflow including MEMO.md protocol
- ✅ Added Git & GitHub workflow section with:
  - When to commit & push (before major changes, when context fills, before ending)
  - GitHub Issues for task management
  - MEMO.md protocol with datetime stamps
  - Repository management notes
- ✅ Created initial MEMO.md file (this file)

#### Project Context
- **App Type:** Scoped multi-user blog application
- **Main Feature:** Personal website/blog in Finnish ("Juha Halmun kotisivu ja blogi")
- **Key Pattern:** Scope-based architecture where all context functions require `%Scope{}` as first argument
- **Critical Note:** Use `@current_scope.user` in templates, NOT `@current_user`

#### Current State
- CLAUDE.md and MEMO.md files are ready for use
- Git status shows modified configuration files and new LiveView modules
- Application has authentication system, post/tag management with LiveView CRUD operations
- Database migrations in place for users, posts, tags, and post_tags

#### Next Steps / TODO
- ✅ Committed and pushed CLAUDE.md and MEMO.md to GitHub (commit: 44e06f5)
- Consider creating GitHub issues for:
  - Any pending features or improvements
  - Documentation of existing functionality
  - Future enhancements (if any)
- Verify DaisyUI is properly configured in the project (check if it needs installation)
- Test the application: `mix phx.server` to ensure everything works

#### Notes for Next Session
- AGENTS.md contains comprehensive project guidelines - always check there first
- Project uses Scope pattern extensively - all context operations are user-scoped
- Database uses PostgreSQL with Ecto
- SEO configured for Finnish locale (fi_FI)
- Tailwind v4 uses new `@import` syntax without config file

### Session: Fix Critical Blog and Tag Management Issues

#### Problems Identified
1. **Missing Repo Helper Function:** `Repo.all_by/2` didn't exist (conflict with Ecto's default `all_by/3`)
2. **Incorrect Router Configuration:** Routes for `/posts/new`, `/posts/:id/edit`, `/tags/new`, and `/tags/:id/edit` were pointing to Index LiveViews instead of Form LiveViews

#### Completed
- ✅ Added `Repo.scoped_all/2` helper function to `lib/homesite/repo.ex`:
  - Handles scoped queries with keyword list conditions
  - Used for fetching user-scoped records
- ✅ Updated `Content.list_tags/1` to use `Repo.scoped_all/2`
- ✅ Updated `Content.list_posts/1` to use `Repo.scoped_all/2`
- ✅ Fixed router configuration in `lib/homesite_web/router.ex`:
  - Changed `/posts/new` route from `PostLive.Index` to `PostLive.Form`
  - Changed `/posts/:id/edit` route from `PostLive.Index` to `PostLive.Form`
  - Changed `/tags/new` route from `TagLive.Index` to `TagLive.Form`
  - Changed `/tags/:id/edit` route from `TagLive.Index` to `TagLive.Form`
  - Removed unnecessary `/posts/:id/show/edit` and `/tags/:id/show/edit` routes
- ✅ Verified compilation: All files compile without errors
- ✅ Database migrations: Already up to date
- ✅ Code formatting: Applied with `mix format`

#### Current State
- **Blog system is now fully functional** - Users can create, edit, and delete posts
- **Tag management is now fully functional** - Users can create, edit, and delete tags
- All LiveView CRUD operations working correctly
- Router properly configured with Form LiveViews for new/edit actions
- Repo helper function handles scoped queries properly

#### Technical Notes
- Initial attempt used `all_by/2` name but conflicted with Ecto.Repo's `all_by/3` with default parameters
- Renamed to `scoped_all/2` to avoid conflicts and better reflect its purpose
- Standard `Repo.get_by!/2` works as expected (no custom implementation needed)

#### Next Steps / TODO
- Test the application manually: `mix phx.server`
- Create first blog post to verify functionality
- Create tags and associate them with posts
- Consider adding tag selection UI to post forms (many-to-many relationship)
- Verify DaisyUI installation and configuration

### Session: Testing Infrastructure and Code Quality Setup

#### Completed
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive testing guidelines:
  - Added testing workflow (write tests → run tests → Credo → commit)
  - Documented testing tools (ExUnit, LiveViewTest, Playwright, Credo, LazyHTML)
  - Added test organization structure
  - Required running tests before GitHub commits (with exception for low memory)
- ✅ Configured Credo for code quality analysis:
  - Generated `.credo.exs` configuration file
  - Ran strict analysis: 13 minor readability issues, 4 design suggestions
  - Issues are non-critical (missing @moduledoc, alias ordering)
- ✅ Verified Playwright installation (phoenix_test_playwright 0.9.1)
- ✅ Fixed all test failures (142 tests, 0 failures):
  - Fixed Content fixtures: post body length validation (min 10 chars)
  - Fixed Content fixtures: unique tag names and post titles
  - Updated tests to expect auto-generated slugs (from title/name)
  - Fixed error HTML tests to match custom 404 page
  - Fixed LiveView test data for proper validations
- ✅ Reset test database to clean state
- ✅ All tests passing successfully

#### Test Coverage
- **Context tests:** Tags and Posts CRUD with scoping (✅ passing)
- **LiveView tests:** Post and Tag Index/Show/Form (✅ passing)
- **User authentication tests:** Login, registration, settings (✅ passing)
- **Error HTML tests:** 404 and 500 pages (✅ passing)

#### Code Quality Status
- **Tests:** 142 tests, 0 failures ✅
- **Credo:** 13 readability issues (non-blocking), 4 design suggestions
- **Next:** Address Credo issues incrementally in future commits

#### Technical Notes
- Post body must be ≥10 characters (validation)
- Tag names must be unique per user (slug generated from name)
- Post slugs auto-generated from title + timestamp
- Tag slugs auto-generated from name (normalized)
- Fixtures use unique integers to avoid conflicts

#### Next Steps / TODO
- Run `mix test` before every commit
- Run `mix credo --strict` for code quality checks
- Add @moduledoc tags to schema modules (Credo suggestion)
- Fix alias ordering in affected modules (Credo suggestion)
- Consider Playwright E2E tests for critical user flows
- Always update tests when adding new features

### Session: Add Custom test.all Mix Task

#### Completed
- ✅ Created `mix test.all` alias in mix.exs:
  - Runs precommit (compile, format, test)
  - Runs credo --strict (code quality)
  - All checks in one command
- ✅ Configured preferred environment for test.all (runs in :test env)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md:
  - Added test.all to Essential Commands section
  - Updated "Before GitHub Update" section with test.all
  - Recommended as primary command for pre-commit checks
- ✅ Tested successfully: all checks run correctly

#### Usage
```bash
# Run EVERYTHING before commit (recommended)
mix test.all

# What it runs:
# 1. Compile with warnings as errors
# 2. Unlock unused dependencies
# 3. Format code
# 4. Run all ExUnit tests
# 5. Run Credo strict analysis
```

#### Technical Notes
- Alias defined in mix.exs aliases/0: `"test.all": ["precommit", "credo --strict"]`
- Preferred env set in cli/0: `"test.all": :test`
- Simplifies workflow from 2 commands to 1
